Execute the test report workflow - reads C:\test_report.md and fixes issues.

Steps:
1. Read test report from Windows path: `C:\test_report.md` (accessible from WSL as `/mnt/c/test_report.md`)
2. Analyze findings and issues in the report
3. Implement fixes for identified problems in the project
4. Start Docker containers: `docker-compose up -d --build`  
5. Perform own testing to verify fixes work
6. Ask user for approval before committing changes
7. After user approval, commit changes with descriptive message
8. Stop Docker containers: `docker-compose down`

This command automates the entire test report processing workflow.
