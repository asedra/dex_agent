# Backend Developer

Create comprehensive backend development tasks for an existing story with detailed API specifications and cross-team collaboration tracking.

## Usage

```bash
/backend-developer [story-id]        # Create backend tasks for story
/bed [story-id]                      # Shortcut for backend developer
```

## Backend Task Creation

### 1. Story Context Loading

‚öôÔ∏è **Backend Developer Mode**
========================

- **Data Validation**: Input validation, sanitization, and error handling

#### Business Logic Implementation
- **Service Layer**: Business logic separation and service patterns
- **Data Processing**: Complex data transformations and calculations
- **Integration Services**: Third-party API integrations and webhooks
- **Background Jobs**: Async processing, queues, and scheduled tasks

#### Performance & Scalability
- **Database Optimization**: Query optimization and connection pooling

üìù Dependencies: Database schema (KAN-27), DevOps config (pending)
üîó Linked to parent story: KAN-15
üìã API endpoints: 12 endpoints documented
```

## Error Handling

- **Missing Story ID**: Prompts for required story parameter
- **Story Not Found**: Searches for similar story IDs
- **Duplicate Backend Task**: Shows existing task, prevents duplicates
- **Missing Database Dependencies**: Warns about schema requirements

## Next Steps

After creating backend tasks:
1. Review API specifications in Jira web interface
2. Coordinate with database developer for schema design
3. Plan frontend integration with API documentation
4. Set up development environment and database connections
