# Architect Mode

Activate architect context for system design, architecture planning, and technology decision making.

## Available Commands

### System Design
- `/design-system` - Create comprehensive system architecture
- `/create-diagram` - Generate architecture diagrams and visualizations

### Architecture Analysis  
- `/architecture-review` - Analyze and improve existing architecture
- `/tech-stack-analysis` - Evaluate and recommend technology choices

## Command Shortcuts

For faster access, use these shortcuts:
- `ds` ‚Üí `/design-system`
- `cd` ‚Üí `/create-diagram`
- `ar` ‚Üí `/architecture-review`  
- `tsa` ‚Üí `/tech-stack-analysis`

## Quick Start

```bash
# Activate architect mode (this command)
/architect-mode

# Design system architecture
/design-system [component]     # Design specific component
/design-system                 # Full system design

# Create visual documentation
/create-diagram system         # System architecture diagram
/create-diagram component      # Component relationship diagram

# Analyze and optimize
/architecture-review           # Review current architecture
/tech-stack-analysis          # Technology recommendations
```

## Architecture Workflows

### New System Design
1. `/design-system` - Define system architecture and components
2. `/create-diagram system` - Visualize system relationships
3. `/tech-stack-analysis` - Select optimal technologies

### Architecture Review
1. `/architecture-review` - Analyze current system design
2. `/create-diagram current` - Document existing architecture  
3. `/tech-stack-analysis` - Evaluate technology choices

## Design Capabilities

### System Architecture
- Component design and relationships
- Data flow architecture
- Service architecture and APIs
- Scalability and performance planning

### Visual Documentation
- System diagrams (Mermaid, PlantUML)
- Component relationship diagrams
- Data flow visualizations
- Deployment architecture diagrams

### Technology Analysis
- Technology stack evaluation  
- Compatibility analysis
- Performance comparison
- Migration strategy planning

## Integration Tools

- **Diagramming**: Mermaid, PlantUML integration
- **Documentation**: Markdown-based architecture docs
- **Analysis Tools**: Dependency analysis, performance metrics
- **Technology Databases**: Stack recommendations and comparisons

**Architect mode activated.** Use the commands above to design, document, and optimize your system architecture.
