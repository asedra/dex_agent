- **Infrastructure Dependencies**: Warns about required DevOps setup

## Next Steps

After creating database tasks:
1. Review schema design in Jira web interface
2. Coordinate with backend developer for data access patterns
3. Plan infrastructure requirements with DevOps engineer
4. Set up development database and migration pipeline
